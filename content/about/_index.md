title: About me

---

On average, I am a data scientist, but I find it standard to deviate into data engineering and data visualization.  

Like many other data scientists, I've started working in data science before data science became a formal career choice. Over the past decade, I've worked as a data analyst for a fraud detection software company, as an information systems programmer for a medical research lab, as a web developer at large, and as a data scientist for a marketing company.
